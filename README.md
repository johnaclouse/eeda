# eeda
Extra Exploratory Data Analysis


# Action items

- Add geospatial visual - median/mode by census tract

- Add geospatial visual - incidence rate of top 20% value individuals per census tract. Top 5% and top 1%

- Move alignx_n from curios to eeda

- Find right home for scale_min_max

- Create autoscale feature. More than three decades becomes psuedo log scaled. Check negative numbers, zero, and numbers very close to zero.

- Add mean standardized difference table for key measures

- Pull plot_colors out as function argument

- Create a eeda color palette

- Create separate targets for rfm and for broad measures

- Create two simple vignettes: 

  - eg variables for univariate
  
  - rfm variables for bivariate (add three independent variables and use rfm as key variables along with age)

- evaluate calls to edarf package for partial dependence (not available on cran and no updates in last 4 years). Consider lares::dalex_variable
